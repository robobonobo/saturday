Overworld is fairly limited - the castle, the assembly, and the surrounding town. Justified in that it is a former royal town - think Versailles. 

Open with audience with the former king. The Constituent assembly has just dissolved the monarchy and placed him under arrest. The king gives his (somewhat prejudiced, somewhat honest) view of the revolution and the incoming government.
